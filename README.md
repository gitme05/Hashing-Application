# Library Book Tracker

The **Library Book Tracker** is a simple console-based Java application that uses a hash table to store and manage library books by their unique IDs.

## What It Can Do

This application allows you to add books to the library, retrieve a book by its ID, and display all the books currently stored in the library.

## Why This Application?

We developed this application to demonstrate how hashing can efficiently store and retrieve data. This application helps in managing library books, providing a fast and reliable solution for small libraries.

## How Does It Contribute?

This project enhances my understanding of hash tables and coding skills while offering a simple solution for small libraries to efficiently manage their books.
